## Project Overview

This project is a React-based web application designed to showcase blog entries about various topics, particularly focusing on the vibrant life in Brooklyn and the resurgence of vintage fashion.

## Project Structure

The application is structured into several main components, each responsible for a part of the website:

- `App.js`: The main React component that holds the state and passes it down to other components.
- `Homepage.jsx`: A component that displays all blog entries.
- `BlogEntries.jsx`: Responsible for rendering the list of blog entries.
- `BlogEntry.jsx`: A component for displaying a single blog entry.
- `Header.jsx` and `Footer.jsx`: Components for the website's header and footer.
- `index.js`: The entry point of the React application.

### Styles

- `App.css`: Contains styles specific to the `App` component.
- `index.css`: General styles that affect the root of the project.
